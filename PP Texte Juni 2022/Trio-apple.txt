TRIO-Appletree How cool is this tree? 

Three popular apple varieties on one tree! The lovely red apple 'Jonagored', the yellow/green 'Golden Delicious' and the light red/yellow 'Elstar' are 3 of the most sold and definitely most loved apple varieties and now they are grafted together on 1 tree. Each with a slightly different flavour, but each one as delicious as the other. 
When planted in a pot the self-pollinating apple tree grows up to approx.. 175cm tall.  Potted, this self-pollinating apple tree will grow to about 150 cm so is perfect for the smaller fruit garden or patio/decking.

Height at delivery: 60-80cm (Measured incl. pot)
