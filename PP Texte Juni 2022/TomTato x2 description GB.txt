Cherry tomatoes grow on the vine, while white potatoes grow from the ground from the same plant. A well cared for 1 year old plant can produce about 250 to 500 tomatoes and 2 kilos of potatoes in its lifetime.

Care
The best part is that caring for TomTato(r) is not difficult at all! Place the Tomtato(r) deep in the soil so that the potatoes can develop well. A little water and nutrition now and then is usually enough for a good harvest. Support the plant properly with sticks and clamps, because it can grow quickly and produce many tomatos, causing it to become heavy. Don't forget to regularly remove the new shoots from the plant. By doing so the Tomtato(r) can put all its energy into the growing process.

Upon delivery, the plants have a height of 25 to 40cm (measured pot included). The plants are delivered in pots with a diameter of 10.5cm.
