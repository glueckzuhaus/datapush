Care
The olive trees are ideal for every garden. You can plant them in tubs and put them on the terrace, but they can also be placed in the open ground. Olive trees like a sunny place and absolutely do not like wet feet. When holding the tree in a pot, always ensure that there are enough holes at the bottom of the pot.
Water regularly in the spring and summer. Pruning is not necessary for the time being, but this is best in early spring or in the fall (around October). The plant has sufficient water but may be fertilized once in a while with Mediterranean plant food, but this is not necessary.
