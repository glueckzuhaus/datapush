Set Of 3 Thunbergia climbing plants

Origin & product information
The Thunbergia Alata, better known as Black-Eyed Susan has become even more colourful. Until recently, the Black-Eyed Susan was only available in yellow and orange but breeders have now managed to create cultivars in other colours. With its magnificent bright colours, this is a splendid subject for the patio or decking.

Thunbergia alata is a fantastic tub plant. Use a large flower pot, planter or hanging basket (minimum diameter of 50 cm) with holes in the base.The long shoots of Thunbergia alata will look amazing trained to cover a frame, a climbing support or bamboo canes. Firmly position the climbing frame in the pot. Black-Eyed Susan is native to tropical Africa and loves heat. It is named after its striking black heart, which looks just like the pupil of an eye. The flowers are white, yellow or orange. This particular fast-growing vine blooms all summer long until late autumn.

Thunbergia alata is usually grown as an annual plant. It is possible to overwinter this perennial in a warm sun lounge or in a greenhouse.
