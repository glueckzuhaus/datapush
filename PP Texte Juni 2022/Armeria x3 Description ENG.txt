Armeria - English grass

A truly fantastic plant that will bloom for months on end. This perennial will bear hundreds of long-blooming flowers from early spring to fall, pausing for only a few weeks during the summer in very hot and dry conditions.
Flowers are bright pink and white on slender stems above "grassy" leaves.

Grooming
This grateful, undemanding perennial does well in poor soils and is even salt tolerant, making it extremely suitable for the edge of a border, but also in a pot or tub. It does not need to be pruned or fertilized.

Plant height
The plants are delivered with a height of 25-40cm
