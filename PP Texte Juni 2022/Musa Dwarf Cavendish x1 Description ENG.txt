Care
The Musa consists of approximately 80% water and for that reason it likes a good drink of water. Therefore, water the plant regularly and make sure the soil never dries out. Furthermore, the plant is keen on rain so treat it sometimes with a summer rain shower or spray it several times per week. Furthermore, the Musa loves light and warmth so do not place it in the shadows. At least five hours direct sunlight per day promotes growth. At a sudden moment, the edges of the leaves could get brown and eventually, the whole leave dies. This is a natural process, so don't be to scared about it. The Musa replaces its old leaves with new leaves. Furthermore, the Musa is not poisonous. And lastly, the Musa is a fast growing plant. Eventually it can grow up to 3-4 meters high!

Plant height
The Musa Dwarf Cavendish will be delivered with a height of approximately 90-100 cm (measured including pot). De pot has a width of 21 cm.
