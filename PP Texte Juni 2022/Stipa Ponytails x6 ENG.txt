Set of 6 Stipa Ponytail ornamental grasses

The Stipa "Ponytail" is also called "Feather grass" in the Netherlands and is a fully hardy, beautiful grass variety. Stipa is an ornamental grass with very fine leaves that can reach a height of approximately 40 cm. The plant has a rich inflorescence of very fine flower stems up to approx. 50 cm high, which wave beautifully in the wind
Stipa likes a spot in full sun or light shade. Beautiful pale yellow-green leaves covered with fluffy panicles of silver-green flowers, maturing to blond yellow. This versatile grass is ideal for a sunny garden, large ornamental pot or perennial border. The waving plumes give a rural and soothing effect in a light breeze. The plant also fits perfectly in an Oriental themed garden.

Grooming
We recommend pruning the Stipa "Ponytails" back to about 20 cm above the ground in spring. The 'Ponytails' will then quickly sprout again, creating fresh 'hairs' again. This ornamental grass remains green in winter and can withstand temperatures down to -15 degrees.

Plant height
Height at delivery is between 10 and 15 cm (measured with pot).
The Stipa grasses are supplied in a 9 cm pot.
