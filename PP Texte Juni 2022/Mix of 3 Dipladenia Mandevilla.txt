Mix of 3 Dipladenia Mandevilla - Pink, White, Red

The Dipladenia, better known today as the Mandevilla, is one of the most rewarding flowering garden plants. From May, until the first frost, this plant surprises everyone with its white trumpet-shaped flowers. That is why the Mandevilla is a very popular flowering plant in gardens, on balconies or terraces. It is a climbing plant that flowers from May to October (or sometimes even until November or early December!). This exotic plant originally comes from South America, but it is also very popular in our garden. The plant flowers for a long time with its fragrant flowers. As a lush grower, it also produces very long tendrils in a short time so that he can easily cover a wall or fence.

Care
The Dipladenia is a very tropical plant but is therefore not hardy. During the winter, place the plants indoors or in a sheltered spot. They need to be watered regularly, in the summer once a day is enough. When it gets colder in the Autumn, you can slowly reduce the amount of times you water them. It is important that the Dipladenia is planted in a big pot that drains well.

The plants are delivered with a height of 25-40 cm (this is measured including the pot). The pot has a diameter of 9 cm.
