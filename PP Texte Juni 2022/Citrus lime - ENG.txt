Care
Citrus trees like a light, sunny place, moderate water and regular fertilizer. With their preference for a bit of acidic soil, you can mix potting soil with some garden peat. To get enough fruits you can fertilize the flowers yourself with your thumb or brush. It takes about a year for the fruits to mature. In terms of location, you can place the plants outside in full sun from mid-March to October, but let them get used to the sun in the first few weeks due to burning. In October you can bring the trees in to let them overwinter there.

Plant height
The plants are delivered with a height of 25-40 cm in a pot size 9 cm
