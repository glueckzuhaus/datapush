Hydrangea paniculata Confetti
Product information
Every day is a party with the Hydrangea paniculate Confetti in your garden! This panicle hydrangea has large, lightly scented flowers with a fantastic colour combination, therefore its name 'Confetti'. The flower plumes have a cheerful colour change from white and pink, with some green at the top. The Hydrangea has fairly open flower spikes. Because of this loose inflorescence, it looks like there has been sprinkled with confetti. 
Care
The Hydrangea Confetti blooms its beautiful plume-shaped flowers from early summer until late autumn. It stays compact which makes it perfect for a pot on the terrace or balcony. The Confetti prefers to stand in the sun or half-shadow. Hydrangeas need a lot of water, especially during the summer months. Furthermore, the Confetti is hardy to -30 degrees Celsius! So you can enjoy the plant every summer. Eventually, the Hydrangea Confetti can grow to a height of about 100 cm. 
The Hydrangea paniculata Confetti will be delivered with a height of about 25-40 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a diameter of 19 cm.
