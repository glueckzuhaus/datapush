Arbutus Unedo is also called "strawberry tree" because of the fruits on the tree, which look like strawberries. These fruits are edible but unfortunately, they do not ripen in every climate, which is why they generally do not taste good. This tree grows into a medium-sized tree with a short, reddish-brown trunk and a compact crown. The strawberry tree is a particularly colourful tree for every garden. In the autumn and early winter, panicles of white and pale pink flowers appear. These can be accompanied by yellow and red berries which look a bit like strawberries. This ornamental tree is common in southern Europe. The strawberry tree is the national tree of Italy because of its shiny green leaves, its white flowers, and its red fruit. These colours are reminiscent of the Italian flag.
Care
The Arbutus needs plenty of water. Do not let the soil dry out too much, but make sure that the water is able to drain out easily. The strawberry tree prefers a place in the sun or half-shadow. The tree can withstand a little wind. Be wary of low temperatures; this plant is not entirely hardy and needs protection during very cold periods. Arbutus can grow between 3 and 5 metres high in our climate. The tree does not need to be pruned. This plant is also evergreen. The fruits need about twelve months to ripen, which makes it a colourful tree at any time of the year!
The plants are delivery with a height of 25-40 cm (measured including the pot). The pot has a diameter of 9 cm.
