Fig Tree - Ficus Carica

The Ficus Carica originates in western Asia. Due to its delicious fruits and the fact that these fruits are easy to keep, cultivation of these trees quickly spread throughout the Mediterranean during the time of the Roman Empire. It was also the Romans who eventually introduced the fig to England. The leaf of the fig tree is best known from the depictions of Adam and Eve, but in classical paintings, the fig leaf is constantly used to cover parts of people. A fig tree is a hardy but deciduous tree and in winter only the beautiful chalk-white trunk remains. The leaves are leathery and can grow very large. The fruits of the fig tree ripen between July and September, after which they are edible. The fig tree is a very nice and easy plant and is a real asset to your garden, balcony or patio.

Care
The Ficus Carica prefers a sunny, sheltered location as warm as possible. The tree can be planted in the ground or kept in a pot. Always ensure good drainage, by placing the plant in a pot with holes at the bottom. When this tree does not receive enought water, the leaves will curl up and become limp. So give more water when the leaves are drooping. Water regularly in the spring and summer, it is important to feel the soil first. Is it still damp? Then no watering. However, also prevent the soil from drying out. During hot summers, the fig tree can be watered every day. A rain shower is not enough to provide the earth with enough water.

The Ficus Carica is delivered with a height of 70-90 cm and with a 21 cm diameter pot.
