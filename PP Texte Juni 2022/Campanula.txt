Campanula portenschlagiana is a vigorous low growing evergreen perennial with beautiful dense rosettes of heart shaped leaves with a rich green colour. Freely flowering from late spring and throughout the summer it produces masses of bell shaped flowers from stems rising above the foliage. An amazing source of vibrant summer colour especially when planted in groups. Spreading mounds of deep purple, funnel-shaped flowers appear in July and August with heart-shaped to kidney-shaped, mid-green leaves that are retained all year. These low-growing Dalmatian bellflowers look wonderful cascading over a sunny, well-drained rock garden or raised bed, used as edging or tucked in between paving stones or a dry-stone wall. This campanula is very vigorous, so it's best planted away from smaller, less competitive plants.
