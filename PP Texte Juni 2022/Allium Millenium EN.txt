About the plant 
The Allium Millenium brings a fairytale atmosphere to your garden with its unusual pink-purple flower bulbs. These beautiful flowers are often visited by bees and butterflies, which makes for a lively garden. The shiny dark green leaves give your garden a boost of green in early spring.  The beautiful flower bulbs will enrich the space with colour between July and September. The plant is perfect for a mixed border and can be planted in large groups. The plant grows quickly and is easy to look after. The Allium Millenium belongs to the onion family. When the leaves are damaged they slightly smell of onion!
