6-pack Festuca Elijah Blue or Blue Fescue

Origin & product information
These beautiful blue-gray grass balls are one of the most popular grasses in the Dutch gardens. The Festuca glauca 'Elijah Blue' or Festuca Glauca Intense Blue is also called Blue Fescue in the Netherlands. It is a very stylish garden plant and excellent evergreen ground cover. The Festuca 'Elijah Blue' look like little cushions in the garden. These beautiful round shapes consist of very fine, intense ice blue leaves that turn greener in winter. From late spring to summer, the plant receives narrow, blue-green plumes of flowers that turn golden brown.

Festuca glauca 'Elijah Blue', originally from southern France, is a beautiful blue ornamental grass that can withstand drought and has a beautiful colour all year round. This plant also retains its colour during the winter and is also hardy to -22 degrees Celsius!
Maintenance is limited to removing old leaves once or twice a year. Planting is possible from spring (March) until autumn. When Festuca is planted as a ground cover, a planting distance of 20 cm between the plants is recommended.
Festuca glauca 'Elijah Blue' comes into its own as a colourful solitaire, but also works well in groups such as ground cover or in a pot on the balcony or terrace. In short, an ideal plant!
