Ludwig Späth is a medium-sized ornamental shrub with gorgeous purple-red flowers that blossom from May until June. The flowers are not only beautiful, they also smell delicious. This Syringa is named after a tree grower from Berlin. Ludwig Späth prefers a moist, well-drained soil and is a true sun worshipper.
Care
The Syringa is very hardy and a deciduous shrub. They are true sun worshippers and love a sunny spot, but also do well in a semi-shaded spot. The more sun the Syringa gets, the more abundantly the flowers will blossom. The Syringa is not demanding when it comes to the type of soil they stand in. The Syringa can be pruned into shape after blossoming, old branches can be removed right away, to give new shoots enough light and space to grow.
