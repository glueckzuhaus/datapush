Product information
The Eucalyptus Gunnii 'Azura' is a Eucalyptus species from France. This beautiful plant is suitable for both outdoor and indoor use. Very striking is the beautiful blue-grey leaves, to which it owes its name Azura. In its younger years it has round leaves that later become elongated. The Eucalyptus Gunnii is the only Eucalyptus species hardy to -10 in the open ground! The leaf of the Eucalyptus is used to extract aromatic oil. If you want to experience the scent of wellness at home for yourself, you can pour boiling water over a handful of the Azura leaves to create your own steam bath that immediately helps you breathe more freely. The plant also keeps mosquitoes and flies away. They don't like the smell of the Eucalyptus.

Care
The Eucalyptus Gunnii likes a sunny spot in well-drained soil.
If you prune the Azura with some regularity, it will remain a compact, smaller shrub. If you don't do this, it can grow into a meter high tree. So depending on your personal preference, the method of pruning is important. If you want to keep it compact, March is the best time to prune it back.
Height
The Eucalyptus Gunnii on a stem comes with a height of 55-65 cm (measured incl. pot). The pot size / diameter of the pot is 17 cm
