The Pelargonium, better known as the anti-mosquito plant or lemon geranium, is a beautiful flowering plant that gives off a sweet citronella scent. These plants are a must-have for the patio table during the months when the mosquitoes are on the lookout again. The scented geraniums are a wonderful addition to the garden but can also be kept as a houseplant, for example in your bedroom or in the living room on the windowsill. This way you will not only keep the mosquitoes outside, but also inside!

Care
Geraniums require little maintenance, but like every plant, they do need some care. Water the Pelargoniums in the summer, otherwise the plant will dry out quickly. The plant is not hardy so beware of frost. Overwinter in a dry and frost-free place, e.g. in a shed or inside on the windowsill.
Upon delivery, the plants have a height of 20 to 30cm (measured pot included). The plants are delivered in pots with a diameter of 10.5cm.
