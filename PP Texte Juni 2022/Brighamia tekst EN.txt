Brighamia tekst EN
The Brighamia is a exotic plant that originates from Hawaii. It's common name is the Hawaiian Palmtree. The plant is endemic to the Hawaii islands. Which means it only grows on Hawaii and nowhere else. This species was threatened with extinction for a long time, but thanks to specialized growing techniques this is no longer the case and in these days it is even available as an indoor plant.  As an indoor plant, the plant is striking because of its distinctive appearance: the fleshy trunk is formed by a large garland of light green leaves, like a large palm, but in miniature. The small yellow flowers appear in October and November.

The Brighamia can loose it's leaves after being moved to a different spot or due to changes in atmosphere. This is a natural occurrence and new leaves will start growing after a short period.
