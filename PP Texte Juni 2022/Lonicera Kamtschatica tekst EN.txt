Lonicera Kamtschatica
Product information
Lonicera kamtschatica, also called 'honeysuckle', is an elegant fruit-bearing shrub that can grow up to 1.5 metres high. This plant is native to north-east Asia and Siberia and is still relatively unknown in other countries The berries of the Lonicera are dark blue and slightly larger than an average berry. The fruits are somewhat similar to blueberries. As the name honeysuckle suggests, the berries taste sweet. The berries are very healthy; they contain a lot of vitamin B and C. The fruits can be used in a dish or eaten just by themselves. Because the berries are fragile and therefore difficult to transport, the fruit is almost only used for personal use and is rarely found on the market. Grow your own honeysuckle in your garden and enjoy these special berries!
Care
The honeysuckle is self-pollinating, bumblebees take care of the pollination. When several honeysuckle plants are placed together, the harvest will be even better. The plant blossoms early; in March and April with small white, slightly fragrant flowers. In May the flowers are replaced by the berries. Lonicera Kamtschatica is very hardy and relatively easy to maintain. The plant likes a spot in half-shadow or full sun and needs plenty of water. Only prune the plant in the first few years after it has been harvested. The honeysuckle will attract bees and butterflies. Birds also love honeysuckle, so it is recommended to cover the plant temporarily with a net or foil.
