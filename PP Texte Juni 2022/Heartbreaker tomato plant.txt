The Heartbreaker tomato plant, nick-named "love-apple", produces delicious cocktail tomatoes with a bright red colour and heart-shaped tip. The skin is soft and the juicy fruit balances sweet and sour perfectly making them a delicious choice for soups and salads or on their own as a healthy snack. Even the smallest terrace or balcony can accommodate a few containers that will give you a great harvest of delicious fresh produce!

Care
You can grow the 'Heartbreaker' tomato indoors or outdoors, but as long as it is in full sun for most of the day it will produce lots of delicious fruit. You do not need to have a large vegetable garden to grow your own. The plant can grow up to 60 cm tall and spread up to 40 cm wide, making it an excellent choice for pots and indoor cultivation.
Upon delivery, the plants have a height of 20 to 30cm (measured pot included). The plants are delivered in pots with a diameter of 10.5cm.
