Syringa vulgaris Michel Buchner has a bushy, widespread growth and is medium-sized. This Syringa has beautiful heart-shaped leaves with cute double flowers in a deep lilac-pink to lilac-blue colour that smell deliciously sweet. They flower from May to June. Michel Buchner also worships the sun and needs a minimum of 5 to 6 hours of full sun per day to bloom abundantly.
Care
The Syringa is very hardy and a deciduous shrub. They are true sun worshippers and love a sunny spot, but also do well in a semi-shaded spot. The more sun the Syringa gets, the more abundantly the flowers will blossom. The Syringa is not demanding when it comes to the type of soil they stand in. The Syringa can be pruned into shape after blossoming, old branches can be removed right away, to give new shoots enough light and space to grow.
Upon delivery, the plants have a height of 25 to 40cm (measured pot included). The plants are delivered in pots with a diameter of 17cm.
